# Thimble

Timble.io’s first e-learning portal was designed and built by its founder 
in 2016 to teach robotics and coding skills to students. Without frequent 
design updates and iterations, the team at Thimble is convinced that it’s 
not providing the best possible way for students to curate/consume educational 
content, learn skills from each other, get certified, and earn an income. 
It is time to innovate and improve the way students learn essential skills online. 

  # Challenge 2 
  Enable students (ages 15+) to curate educational content at home
   using innovative user interfaces and user experiences (UI/UX) on Thimble’s E-Learning
   Portal. In short, if you had to create/consume essential content online (ie., how to learn 
   about the Metaverse and NFTs), how would you want this information presented and delivered 
   to you in a more engaging way? (ie., would you want a course builder? videos? forum? How
   would you structure a course? Since this curriculum/learning needs to be created so no 
   language is a barrier to learning and teacher, what do you think are some ways to solve this?

# Solution
Engaging and Accessible user experience to learn essential content online i.e. Web 3.0 and NFTS.

An application where professionals create short video content to provide students with entertaining education, easily accessible videos, opportunities, and certifications.
